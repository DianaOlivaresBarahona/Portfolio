          <h1>Diana Barahona Olivares</h1>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Diana, and I'm a 33-year-old junior professional
            with a passion for design. Although I’m early in my career, I’ve
            quickly developed a strong foundation in ux-design, frontend skills
            and I’m excited to grow and take on new challenges that allow me to
            expand my expertise. I’m committed to innovation, creativity,
            problem-solving and I approach every project with enthusiasm and a
            willingness to learn. My goal is to continually improve my skill
            set, contributing to meaningful projects while also gaining valuable
            experience along the way. Whether working independently or
            collaborating with teams, I bring a positive attitude and a strong
            work ethic to everything I do and I try to always keep a positive
            mind. Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy traveling with my
            family, going to the gym, dancing and horseback riding, which help
            me maintain balance and fuel my creativity. I’m excited to connect
            with others in the field, exchange ideas, and explore opportunities
            that will help me grow both professionally and personally.
          </p>
